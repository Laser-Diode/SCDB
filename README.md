# Self-Contained Demo Box
A script that will make a default raspian system into a self contained demonstration device.

For proper execution, get the install.sh script onto the raspbian device and then run:
sudo bash install.sh

This will cause the device to update, disconnect from current networks, reboot and provice a new access point.

The default password for that access point is "maycontainharmfulfiles"
